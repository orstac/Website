            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <hr>
            <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
            OrsTac is located at: Pittsburgh, PA, USA<br />
            <address>
                OrsTac<br /><br />0000000000 </address>

            <p>It is OrsTac's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
                our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://orstac.com/">orstac.com</a> (hereinafter,
                "us", "we", or "orstac.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally
                identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
                ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this
                information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy
                Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection
                of information from other sources.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
                rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our
                Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
            <p>Like most website operators, OrsTac collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
                browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
                site, and the date and time of each visitor request. OrsTac's purpose in collecting non-personally
                identifying information is to better understand how OrsTac's visitors use its website. From time to
                time, OrsTac may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
                report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p>OrsTac also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
                for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://orstac.com blog posts. OrsTac only
                discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
                discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>Certain visitors to OrsTac's websites choose to interact with OrsTac in ways that require OrsTac to
                gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that OrsTac gathers
                depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
                http://orstac.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
                over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
                acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
            <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows
                ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
                interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by OrsTac and does not cover the use of
                cookies by any advertisers.</p>


            <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third
                party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the
                Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
            <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of
                any third party sites, products or services.</p>



            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
            <p>OrsTac may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. OrsTac may display this
                information publicly or provide it to others. However, OrsTac does not disclose your
                personally-identifying information.</p>


            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, OrsTac uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services
                provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences
                on your computer.</p>
            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's
                browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. OrsTac uses cookies to help OrsTac
                identify and track visitors, their usage of http://orstac.com, and their website access preferences.
                OrsTac visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to
                refuse cookies before using OrsTac's websites, with the drawback that certain features of OrsTac's
                websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
            <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and
                agree to OrsTac's use of cookies.</p>



            <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, OrsTac may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and
                in OrsTac's sole discretion. OrsTac encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
                its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will
                constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
